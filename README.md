// js will search through student records database and display student's data in the browser.
//Will also react to 'clear' and 'quit'. Not case sensitive. Displays 'no records' where no data.

//unique: jS is dynamic: add or substract to studentRecords[] && elements[] alike to see changes
//without changing the jS.  

// All function elements are connected, which means they work great together, but will
// not be able to extract it and use somewhere else without syntax changes. Also,
//errors will snowball.
